The Bangla language, spoken by over 300 million people, lacks comprehensive NLP tools for spelling and grammar correction. This thesis presents \textbf{Byakaron}, a hybrid spell and grammar checker combining statistical N-gram models with rule-based correction for context-aware language correction.

The project makes three key contributions. First, we processed the Bengali Wikipedia dump to create a structured corpus of 2+ million sentences, 0.55 million unique words, and 5.4 million bigrams for statistical language modeling. Second, we developed modular NLP tools including tokenization, normalization, and stemming components in TypeScript. Third, we built a multi-stage spell checker achieving 87.3\% error detection and 78.5\% top-1 correction accuracy through exact match, phonetic matching, fuzzy matching, and N-gram context ranking.

Byakaron is implemented as a responsive Next.js web application with real-time spell checking. Although the spell checker shows promising results, grammar checking remains at 10\% completion for future work. The entire project is released as open-source software.
